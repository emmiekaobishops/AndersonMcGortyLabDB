Initial commit:
- files are present and have some sort of structure; however, there is no way to verify that the code works without a database and table
- there is a main page (index.html) with all of the materials and some preliminary information, and it is also possible to click on the name of a material
- after clicking, the user should be brought to a page with more information on the different properties (item.html)
-  item.html isn't formatted yet, since we're not quite sure what the extent of the content of different properties will be
-  there is a nevbar and a search bar, but neither are active/working yet
